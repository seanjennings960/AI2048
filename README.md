# AI2048

This repository is an application of reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Goals

1. ~~Estimate the cumulative return that will follow a particular state using a
   Neural net model~~
2. Track metrics of how well a particular model can fit a policy.

    How does a particular model fit a new policy?

3. Update a policy based on model and detect an improvement!
4. Beat 2048
